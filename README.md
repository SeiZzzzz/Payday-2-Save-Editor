Edit Payday 2 saves on PC, change user ID, backup, and more.

All you need to do is download Python 2.7 and the file.

Run the file*, and follow the guidance inside the program.

* If you don't know how to run python file:
open cmd
write: cd "<The location of you saves folder and the script location>"
press enter
write: "<Python location>\python.exe" <filename>.py

OR

Just double click on the file, in some computers it'll open an editor so.. based on luck I think.

* If you don't know how to get your SteamID64 (the new id) enter: https://steamid.io/
Inside the search enter your profile link on http://steamcommunity.com/ than on the list search your steamID64.
You'll get number like 7656XXXXXXXXXXXXX. That's the number you'll need to the program.
